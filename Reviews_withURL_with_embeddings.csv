delicious at least they are in the oneounce bagshopefully the same product in the ounce bags will taste the same these are definitely chips for adults however andor children whose strongerthanadult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips they are not the strongest flavour i have ever hadthat was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even mebr these backyard barbeque chips by kettle however have just the right amount of sweetness with honey powder onion and sugar to take the edge of the stonger flavoursbr paprika chili pepper cayenne pepper and natural smoke flavour of which there is less they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweetenersbr br the complete list of ingredients of these kettle backyard barbecue chips in the ounce bags and hopefully in the ounce bags as well is as followsbr br potatoesbr vegetable oil safflower and sunflower oilbr honey powder dried cane sugar honeybr rice powderbr sugarbr saltbr onion powderbr tomato powderbr paprikabr torula yeastbr garlic powderbr chili pepperbr citric acidbr cayenne pepperbr paprika oleoresin colourbr natural smoke flavourbr br naturally cooked natural ingredients the combination is a true taste treatbr br of course as with all ptato chips moderation is the keybr potatoes contain a lot of potassiumwhich gives energy and othr good thingsbut too much of which can damage kindneys the vegetable oil is great but too much oil as well as too much starch from the potatoes can hurt the eyes natural smoke flavour is so yummybut it as well as sugar has in very large amounts been linked to cancer productionbr br as far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go thisbr can be ameliorated a bit by drinking teawhich is good for the eyes but as far as the potassium energy good too much bad for the kidneys and the sugar and natural smoke flavour too much leading to cancer production the only thing is to do what is good in everythingm o d e r a t i o nbr br twice or three times a month i allow myself to go on what i call a potato chip diet i eat only one large bag or the equivalent in small ones of potato chips all day i supplement this with tea coffee and lemonade as well as several servings of carnation instant breakfast essentials i like the dark chocolate flavour this adds up to fewer calories than i would normally eat if i had my normal three meals a day plus snacks it also teaches me to eat slowly because that one big bag or many little bags never lasts as long as id like anyway with excercise and sensible eating the rest of the month and keeping my scale nearby and weighing myself at least twice a day every day ive taken off ten pounds in the last three months br br these backyard barbeque flavour potato chips from kettlebr are totally scrumptious except for those jalapino chips which tasted good but were far too spicy for my own taste buds i have yet to meet a potato chip i didnt like to eat these kettle backyard barbeque flavour potato chips with their combination of potatoes sweetness and spices have truly become one of my top five favouritesif not the very first favourite of allbr br flavoured potato

interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleverydaysaquin are these really different companies under the auspices of amazon or is it amazon by a different name only like the other reviewer said he ordered something that said alive and aware in the description and when it came it was from saquinhalal everyday who knows i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazonbr br for now i am going to seek out another source not through amazon that stands behind their cacao it is very important to me for health benefits and the ecologicalsocial impacts of where it is harvested to know that i am getting topnotch certified organic raw cacao if amazon is going to be so wishywashy and sneaky im going elsewhere wagging finger at amazonbr br i think for now i will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it backbr br heavens to besty this stuff rocks it is such a good value too maybe the best out there as i have def shopped around i have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder and this is certainly topnotch kudos to alive and aware for offering it at such a reasonable pricebr i am not a raw foodie per say but i try to follow a neopaleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao properly prepared with just enough natural sweetener i think this is a truly guiltfree pleasure it is loaded with antioxidants as you probably know so go ahead get the big bag you can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food of the gods theobroma as they say br my favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa i just whisk it into gently heated fresh raw whole milk or cream so its not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible i know its not raw but hey this is how i love it add just enough sweetener i like sorghum molasses a scant tspoon a bit of maca powder a dash of real salt and after thats thoroughly whisked i top it off with a spoonful of evo coconut oil yumm i have converted everyone even the kids i babysit who used to prefer swiss miss or i make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk lightly sweetened you better believe it goes fast i love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins a d and the x factor read weston a price and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry i am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happybr also process it with evo coconut oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil i often toss in soakeddried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars just process in batches so its kind of homogenous like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or rawbr go for it buy this huge bag share the goodness and youll be healthier and happier for it i guarantee peace be with you,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004EKO2HE,5,"[0.2683635652065277, -0.1391787827014923, -0.2090548872947693, 0.21691901981830597, 0.24739253520965576, -0.06319978088140488,
